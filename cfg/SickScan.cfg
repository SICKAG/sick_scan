# Important: The min_ang and max_ang are relative to the x-axis of ROS. 
#            The coordinate system of ROS differs from the SICK coordinate system.
# 	     So be aware, if you compare the rviz output with the SOPAS ET output.
#            I.e. the Sopas-Y-Axis is the ROS-X-Axis.
#
#	     This convention is consistent to the ROS coordinate convention
#
#            see: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#coordinate-frame-conventions
